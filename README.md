🔬👩🏻‍🔬| I tag myself as a 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘀𝘁. I have centered a big part of my scientific career to 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗶𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗳𝗶𝗲𝗹𝗱, hoping to find answers to the big questions behind neurological and cardiovascular diseases.⁣ ⁣During the course of my PhD I grew fascinated by the formation of cardiac structures during embryonic development and the onset of regeneration processes after injury in the adult heart. 

👩🏻‍🏫| I also enjoy 𝘀𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 that was once taught to me, and I have always combined my research with teaching practical classes to undergraduate and master students.

👩🏻‍💻| Immersed in the world of 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗦𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲, to fully exploit the potential of existing data and machine learning tools.
⁣⁣
🎯| My life in academia has made me realize that I thrive for a practical approach to these important questions, always aiming to contribute to a greater benefit to society. I would love to apply the knowledge I have built up over the years on my next professional challenge!⁣⁣
